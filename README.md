# Signal-analysis
# Capacitor Capacity Testing
This project presents an in-depth analysis of a basic RC (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit using Arduino Uno. The main focus is on determining the charging time of a capacitor and estimating its capacity based on obtained measurements.
## Project Goals
- Understanding the construction of a basic RC circuit: Using Arduino Uno to build and analyze the circuit.
- Determining capacitor charging time: Using Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws to estimate the charging time.
- Analyzing obtained results: Calculating the capacitor's capacity based on the measurements and analyzing the accuracy.
